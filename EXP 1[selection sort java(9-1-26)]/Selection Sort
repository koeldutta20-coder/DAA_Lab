What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.

Idea:

Divide the array into sorted and unsorted parts

Repeatedly select the smallest element from the unsorted part

Swap it with the first element of the unsorted part

🔁 How Selection Sort Works (Step-by-Step)

Given array:
[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

Find smallest → 11 → swap with 64
[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]

Find smallest in remaining → 12 → swap with 25
[11, 12, 25, 22, 64]

Find smallest → 22 → swap with 25
[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

Find smallest → 25 → already in place

✅ Array is sorted.
