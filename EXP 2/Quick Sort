 Definition

**Quick Sort** is a **divide-and-conquer based sorting algorithm** that sorts an array by selecting a **pivot element**, partitioning the array around the pivot, and then recursively sorting the sub-arrays.

## 🧠 Basic Idea

1. Choose a **pivot** element from the array
2. Rearrange elements such that

   * Elements **smaller than pivot** go to the left
   * Elements **greater than pivot** go to the right
3. Pivot is placed in its **correct position**
4. Recursively apply the same process to left and right sub-arrays

## 🔁 Working of Quick Sort (Step-wise)

Given array:
`[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`

1. Choose pivot → `5`
2. Partition array → `[1] 5 [10, 7, 8, 9]`
3. Apply quick sort to left and right sub-arrays
4. Repeat until each sub-array has one element

✔ Sorted array: `[1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

## ⚙ Partitioning

Partitioning is the key step in Quick Sort.

Common pivot choices:

* First element
* Last element (most common)
* Middle element
* Random element

After partitioning:

* Pivot is in its **final sorted position**
* No element on the left is greater than pivot
* No element on the right is smaller than pivot

## ⏱ Time Complexity

| Case         | Complexity     |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Best Case    | **O(n log n)** |
| Average Case | **O(n log n)** |
| Worst Case   | **O(n²)**      |

📉 Worst case occurs when:

* Array is already sorted
* Pivot is always the smallest or largest element

---

## 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(log n)** (recursive stack, best/average case)
* **O(n)** (worst case)
